# Authboss Gin Sample

Inspired by https://github.com/volatiletech/authboss-sample Authboss Gin Sample
is an over simplification trying to explain how to use authboss together with
the gin-gonic http golang framework.

Basic features:

- API Usage
- Basic Authentication

**Note**: Project is yet under construction.

# Disclaimer

This sample is NOT a seed project. Do not use it as one. It is used as an
example of how to use the Authboss API. This means if you copy-paste code from
this sample you are likely opening yourself up to various security holes, bad
practice, and bad design. It's a demonstration of the surface API of Authboss
and how the library can be used to make a functioning web project.
